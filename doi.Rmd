## Note to Reader
US wildfires from 1992-2009 broken down by year,month,day,cause and county.<br>
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition?select=data.csv <br>
Data can be filtered by using the state dropdown, and clicking on a specific class, cause, day, county etc.<br>
To remove filters simply click the selected metrics again.<br>
The dashboard can also be made full screen using the button in the bottom right.<br>
Note: County data for some states is either missing or incomplete, there will be empty space for these counties.<br>
In some cases the map may also zoom all the way out. This is an indication that there was no county data for your filter combination. We also reiterate that the data shown and analysis below is based on 1992-2009 fire data.<br>

## General Wildfire Trends across the United States
Roughly half (49.8%) of all wildfires occur during the months of March, April, July and August. The 4th of July is the day with the most wildfires with over 400 each year, which is unsurprising given the widespread use of fireworks for the holiday. The overwhelming majority (84.2%) of these fires are smaller than 10 acres, with 35.7% of all fires being smaller than a quarter of an acre. 

Nearly one fifth (19.9%) of all wildfires observed had natural causes. These fires appear to cause the most damage, being responsible for covering just under two-thirds (65.7%) of the total area affected. Fires with an area of 100 acres or more are considerably rarer, making up about 3.2% of all wildfires. Roughly one third (33.4%) of those large fires had natural causes. 

## General Wildfire Trends across Texas
The year 2008 saw the most wildfires in the state: 18,062. The causes of these wildfires were either due to debris and open burning, or unknown. Bastrop country saw the most wildfires in TX in 2008: 396. Most of them were caused due to debris and open burning. Unlike most of the wildfires that typically occur in the state, most of the wildfires in Bastrop county in 2008 were classified as Class A. According to the chart, most wildfires in Texas typically occur around New Years. Given that most people celebrate by bursting firecrackers, the data here makes sense. However, in 2008, most of the wildfires took place on January 26th, with a total of 10 wildfires occurring on that single day.

The least amount of wildfires happened in 1997: only 762. According to the map, all of them occurred in East Texas. Most of them were classified as Class B and occurred due to debris and open burning. Overall, one can analyze and predict that most fires occur in East Texas along the Louisiana and Arkansas border. It is quite predictable that debris is quite common in that area. East Texas seems to have quite a lot of destruction that is left unattended by local residents and state officials. As a result, they turn into natural disasters
